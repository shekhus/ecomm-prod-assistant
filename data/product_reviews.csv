Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22. Portarit blur is more perfect in s22 but pixel 7 is real smart in image processing. This camera doesn't have manual mode so i was lil concern but when i started i never felt any need. Oh my god the night mode is just awesome. A few cons of camera are 1. Wide angle is not that wide and edge detection in portrait is not good. Cinematic blur is a beta feature...

Exchange guys, taking extra cash by just causing unnecessary trouble. They don't approve without paying extra cash to them. Flipkart should look into it.

Everything is perfect except 3 things in the battery department. 1.No charger. 2.Slow charging. 3.Small battery. I suggest Google to look into this matter seriously to upgrade in pixel 9 series to the present market trend, otherwise they will be fade out just like Nokia.
